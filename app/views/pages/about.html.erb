            <h1>About This Project</h1>
            <p>This is my first attempt at building a website as a part of The Essential Web Developer Course at Upskill.com </p>
            The course consists of 200 lessons covering a wide range of web development aspects.</br>
            <h2>About the instructor</h2>

            <h2>Content covered</h2>
            This course begins with a deep dive into full-stack web development and learning about how apps work. It teaches basic principles of HTML, 
            CSS and Ruby, as well as efficient software development principles in order to implement those from the very start. It then shows how to use existing 
            software packages (gems) to add functionality to a Ruby application. During this course I've learned about HTTP request methods which are the key element of all Web applications. 
            I have also learned how to build view, controller and model files and how to link them together to enable users to navigate between individual web pages and forms. This project is built on Amazon AWS Cloud9 platform
            and currently deployed on Heroku hosting service. You can find all my code branches at my Github <%= link_to "profile.", "https://github.com/capthub/upskills_saas_tutorial" %> </br>
